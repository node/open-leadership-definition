# Open Leadership Definition

## About
Every organization—every team, every firm, every community—needs leaders. And open organizations need _open_ leaders. Anyone can be an open leader, not just those with organizational rank or formal titles. The Open Leadership Definition describes the mindsets and behaviors that distinguish open leaders from other types of leaders. It offers practitioners a useful resource for rethinking and reinventing their leadership styles in response to a rapidly changing world. Openly licensed and community-produced, the Open Leadership Definition is a robust and detailed guide to building teams that are more engaged, accountable, innovative, and resilient.

The Open Organization community uses files in this repository to maintain a definition of "open leadership."
