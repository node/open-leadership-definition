# The Open Leadership Definition

## Preamble
Every organization needs leaders. But a leader needn't be someone endowed with formal authority, whether by virtue of position in the organization's hierarchy or extensive tenure with the organization.  Fundamentally, a leader is anyone in a group, team, department, or enterprise who performs one or more critical leadership functions, such as:

- Establishing a compelling vision and strategic direction for the organization
- Clarifying the values and principles that guide the organization and inform its identity
- Reinforcing the connections that unite the organization's members
- Maintaining a sense of positive organizational momentum in the face of potential setbacks and critical decisions
- Mentoring or otherwise influencing the personal and professional development of everyone in the organization

Open organizations require open leaders and let the (open organization principles)[https://theopenorganization.org/definition/] guide their approach. Simply put, open leaders help build open organizations and establish conditions for others to thrive in those organizations. When they do this, they create organizations full of people who are more:

- Engaged, because they feel more invested in the organization's success
- Accountable, because responsibilities and consequences are undeniably clear
- Innovative, because members with diverse backgrounds, insights, and perspectives can apply their talents to a range of challenges and approach their work with genuine curiosity
- Reflective, because they readily share their perspectives on the context of their work and are attuned to their shortcomings and limitations
- Flexible and risk-tolerant, because they feel empowered and safe to change organizational systems and processes to solve problems the ways they feel are best

## Characteristics of open leadership

Open leadership is a mindset and set of behaviors that anyone can learn and practice. Open Leaders think and act in service to another person, group, team, or enterprise attempting to accomplish something together. They are people with character, who give agency to those around them. In this way, their role as leaders is not permanent or predestined; it is evolving and fluid given the task at hand. Open leaders are especially adept at building organizations that embody (the  character of an open organization)[https://theopenorganization.org/definition/]—transparency, inclusivity, adaptability, collaboration, and community—and operate according to these characteristics. And because these principles are interconnected, open leaders espouse all of them.

### Transparency
Open leaders encourage clear, candid interactions among team members, between teams, and across their organizations. Like other leaders, they share the results of their work and the outcomes of their decisions. But open leaders often do more than this. They share the rationale for their work, their motivations for undertaking it, the purposes it serves, and the lines of power and authority that have influenced it. They indicate the parties involved in making a decision—and whenever possible, they invite others to join the decision-making processes (see also collaboration). They explain the criteria stakeholders used to guide a decision. They explain why certain options weren't chosen or adopted, why particular avenues weren't pursued. And when they communicate the results of their work or the outcomes of their decisions with others, they consider external parties, stakeholders, and communities' needs the same way they consider their teammates'. In short, they make all aspects of their work more transparent and accessible to others—even though this often means the work requires more time, involves more discussion among more people, and leads to more questions along the way.

#### What open leaders think
- Everyone deserves clear, direct, and constructive feedback that's as unbiased as possible, and I should expect to receive it from others.
- Does everyone affected by or interested in this decision understand who made it and how we arrived at it?
- All members of the organization are potentially stakeholders in my work and partners in my decisions and should have access to materials about them if they want them.
- Vendors, partners, customers, communities, and other external stakeholders are also members of my open organization, and I need to be as transparent and share information and knowledge as much as possible by demonstrating the same consistency in behavior.
- Even though this situation doesn't allow me to be as transparent as others might expect, have I explained it as thoroughly as I can?
- People will trust and respect my leadership ability only if I'm honest with them and provide as much detail as possible.

#### How open leaders act

- Make notes, records, and procedural documents accessible to others "by default"
- Take time to make materials accessible to others at the outset of a project or decision-making process
- Continually converse with organizational stakeholders about the progress of their projects and important decisions that might affect them
- Often without prompting, share the context for their teams' work, explain their understanding of its purpose and importance, and remove barriers to any information and resources their teams might require for doing their best work
- Create spaces where people feel comfortable voicing concerns and speaking candidly about perceived shortcomings or limitations of ongoing work,and share their own concerns to the degree they are comfortable
- Encourage others to share stories about both their successes and their failures without fear of repercussion, and share their own when possible
